# PokeDexCompositional
Pokedex App created using CollectionView Compositional Layout. This app works on both iPhone and iPad. This is a live app which gets pokemon data including images, pokemon info and stats.

The main highlights of this app includes:
- Custom header created using UIBezierPath()
- ColletionView Compositional Layout to show different sized cards based on screen size.
- Diffiable datasoure
- Little animations for highlighting and unhighlighting collectionView cells.
- A custom transition manager to show and dismiss Pokemon Details Page.
- Simple animations in sequence which execute one by one.

**Note**: I will keep adding new updates to the app.
